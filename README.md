# Welcome to my PersonalSite

The code in this Repo is just a simple Angular app I put together to share a bit about me and my career. It is nothing flashy and probably could have been done with simple HTML, CSS, and JS. Though I thought it would be fun to build it in Angular. I will continue to update this with more projects or new info as my career progresses.

## Building the App

If you would like to run the app locally just clone this repo and run the following command in your terminal from the project directory.
```bash
ng serve -o
```
That should start the app up for you and open it on your default browser at localhost:4200.

## Other Projects

I'll periodically add some more projects to this secion as I complete them.
